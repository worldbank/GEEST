# Icon Extraction Summary

## Overview

Successfully extracted all base64-encoded images from the Gender Enabling Environments Spatial Tool User Manual and replaced them with file references.

## What was done

1. **Identified 37 unique base64-encoded PNG images** in the markdown file
2. **Extracted all images to the `images/` folder** as separate PNG files
3. **Replaced all base64 references** with file paths to the extracted images
4. **Applied meaningful names** to the most commonly used tab icons:
   - `setup_tab.png` - Setup Tab icon
   - `dimension_aggregation_tab.png` - Dimension Aggregation Tab icon  
   - `insights_tab.png` - Insights Tab icon
   - `raster_output_error.png` - Raster Output Error icon
   - `country_boundary_error.png` - Country Boundary Error icon
5. **Left larger screenshots** with generic names (icon_06.png through icon_37.png)

## File sizes

- **Small tab icons**: 374-487 bytes each
- **Large screenshots**: Range from 11,951 bytes to 1,205,122 bytes
- **Total extracted**: 37 unique images

## Benefits

- **Dramatically reduced file size** of the markdown document
- **Improved maintainability** - images can now be updated independently
- **Better version control** - images are separate from text content
- **Easier editing** - no more massive base64 strings cluttering the markdown
- **Better accessibility** - proper alt text can be added for images
- **Reusable assets** - images can be referenced from other documents

## Notes

- The document now uses relative paths to the images folder
- Images retain their original quality and format (PNG)
- The markdown structure and content remain unchanged, only image references were updated
