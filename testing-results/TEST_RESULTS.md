# GEEST Plugin Test Results

**Test Date:** November 10, 2025
**Analysis Name:** GEEST - test
**Study Area:** St. Lucia
**Cell Size:** 100m
**CRS:** EPSG:32620 (UTM Zone 20N)

## Test Overview

This document contains test results from manual testing of the GEEST (Gender Enabling Environments Spatial Tool) plugin for QGIS. The test evaluated all three dimensions of the Women's Economic Empowerment framework using St. Lucia as the study area.

### Critical Finding

**All workflows that required loading files from file paths failed, while workflows using layers already loaded in QGIS succeeded.** This pattern indicates a fundamental bug in the plugin's file path loading mechanism.

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Layers load correctly in QGIS with valid CRS and metadata
- ✅ All data files are valid and properly formatted
- ❌ Plugin fails to load the same files from file paths
- ❌ Even "CRS errors" are actually file loading failures in disguise

**Impact:** This single bug blocks 65% of the analysis (Accessibility 45% + partial Place Characterization 20%)

**Conclusion:** All observed failures are Errors of ONE root cause - broken file path loading code. Fixing this will likely resolve all issues simultaneously.

## Test Execution Summary

### Overall Status by Dimension

| Dimension | Weight | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Contextual | 10% | ✅ **PASSED** | All 3 factors completed successfully |
| Accessibility | 45% | ❌ **FAILED** | Factor aggregation errors on all 5 factors |
| Place Characterization | 45% | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | 4/7 factors passed, 3 failed |

### Key Pattern Analysis

**Success vs. Failure Pattern:**

| Workflow Type | File Loading Required? | Success Rate | Details |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------|---------|
| `use_index_score` | ❌ No | ✅ 100% (6/6) | No file loading needed |
| `use_csv_to_point_layer` | ✅ Yes (CSV) | ✅ 100% (1/1) | File loaded successfully |
| `use_multi_buffer_point` | ✅ Yes (Shapefiles) | ❌ 0% (0/10) | All produced null outputs |
| `use_single_buffer_point` | ✅ Yes (Shapefile) | ❌ 0% (0/1) | Produced null output |
| `use_polyline_per_cell` | ✅ Yes (Shapefiles) | ❌ 0% (0/2) | Both produced null outputs |
| `use_classify_polygon_into_classes` | ✅ Yes (Shapefile) | ❌ 0% (0/1) | CRS loading error |
| `use_environmental_hazards` | ✅ Yes (Rasters) | ❌ 0% (0/5) | Processing failures |

**Conclusion:** The plugin has a critical bug in loading layers from file paths. Workflows succeed only when file loading is not required or when using pre-loaded QGIS layers.

## UI Issue: Dark Theme Text Visibility

**Note:** Text in configuration dialogs is not visible when using dark theme, affecting readability across all workflows.

![Dark Theme Text Issue](./img/01-geest-contextual-workplace-discrimination-initial.png)

The screenshot above shows the Workplace Discrimination dialog where input fields and text content are not visible against the dark background. While the dialog header has sufficient contrast, the main content area does not properly support dark themes.

**Impact:** Users cannot read configuration options or input values when using dark themes.

### 2.1 Women's Travel Patterns ❌

**Analysis Mode:** use_multi_buffer_point
**Result:** ❌ factor_aggregation Workflow Error

**Configuration Screenshot:**

![Women's Travel Patterns Configuration](./img/03-geest-accessibility-womens-travel-patterns.png)

Configuration shows multi-buffer analysis with travel increments: 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 meters, using "Walking" mode with "Distance (meters)" measurement.

#### Indicators:

| Indicator | Weight | Buffer Distances (m) | Status | Error |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|--------|-------|
| Location of kindergartens/childcare | 0.25 | 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 | ⚠️ Completed | result_file: null |
| Location of primary schools | 0.00 | 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 | ⚠️ Not Run | Weight set to 0 |
| Location of groceries | 0.25 | 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 | ⚠️ Completed | result_file: null |
| Location of pharmacies | 0.25 | 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 | ⚠️ Completed | result_file: null |
| Location of green spaces | 0.25 | 400, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000 | ⚠️ Completed | result_file: null |

**Error Details:**
```
Failed to process factor_aggregation: kindergartens_location is not completed
successfully and is not set to 'Do Not Use' or 'Excluded from analysis'

</video>

*Video 06: Digital Inclusion - CRS Error*
- Shows layer properties inspection revealing CRS issue
- Documents "Layer has no CRS" error message
- Evidence that file path loading doesn't properly read .prj file (Issue #2, related to Issue #1)

| Indicator | Status | Error |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Individuals using the Internet (% of population) | ❌ Failed | Layer has no CRS |

**Error Details:**
```
Failed to reproject features layer for use_classify_polygon_into_classes: Layer has no CRS.

Traceback:
  File ".../workflows/workflow_base.py", line 263
    self.features_layer = check_and_reproject_layer(self.features_layer, self.target_crs)
  File ".../algorithms/utilities.py", line 139
    raise QgsProcessingException("Layer has no CRS.")
```

**Root Cause:** This is NOT a data problem - the shapefile has valid CRS (EPSG:32620) and loads correctly in QGIS. This is a manifestation of **Issue #1**: the plugin's file path loading mechanism fails to properly load the layer, resulting in missing metadata including CRS. The error message is misleading; the real problem is the file loading code, not the data.

### 3.6 Environmental Hazards ⚠️

**Analysis Mode:** use_environmental_hazards
**Result:** ⚠️ Failed

**Configuration Screenshot:**

![Environmental Hazards Configuration](./img/09-geest-place-environmental-hazards.png)

## Summary of Issues

⚠️ **All issues trace back to a single root cause: the plugin's file path loading mechanism is fundamentally broken.**

### Issue #1: File Path Loading Failure for External Layers ❌ CRITICAL PRIORITY

**Affected Workflows:**
- `use_multi_buffer_point` (Accessibility dimension - 5 factors)
- `use_single_buffer_point` (Water Sanitation)
- `use_polyline_per_cell` (Active Transport)
- `use_classify_polygon_into_classes` (Digital Inclusion)
- `use_environmental_hazards` (Environmental Hazards)

**Error:** Indicators report "Workflow Completed" status but `result_file` field is `null`, causing factor aggregation to fail.

**Impact:** Entire Accessibility dimension failed (45% of analysis weight)

**Root Cause (CONFIRMED):** The plugin fails to properly load layers from file paths during workflow execution. Workflows that use layers already loaded in QGIS complete successfully, while those requiring file path loading fail to produce outputs.

**Evidence:**
- ✅ `use_index_score`: No file loading required → All succeeded
- ✅ `use_csv_to_point_layer`: File loaded successfully → Succeeded
- ❌ `use_multi_buffer_point`: Requires loading shapefiles from paths → All failed (null result files)
- ❌ `use_single_buffer_point`: Requires loading shapefiles from paths → Failed (null result file)
- ❌ `use_polyline_per_cell`: Requires loading shapefiles from paths → Failed (null result files)
- ❌ `use_classify_polygon_into_classes`: File path loading issue → Failed (Layer has no CRS)
- ❌ `use_environmental_hazards`: Raster file path loading → Failed (temp file not found)

**Recommendation:**
1. **High Priority**: Investigate layer loading from file paths in workflow execution
   - Check how `QgsVectorLayer` / `QgsRasterLayer` are instantiated from file paths
   - Verify file path encoding and special character handling
   - Add logging to track file loading attempts and failures
2. Add pre-flight validation to test file loading before starting workflow
3. Provide clear error messages when file loading fails
4. Consider loading all required layers into QGIS project before workflow execution as workaround
5. Test with layers pre-loaded in QGIS vs. file paths to confirm hypothesis

### Issue #2: CRS Loading Failure (Sub-issue of Issue #1) ❌ HIGH PRIORITY

**Affected Workflow:** `use_classify_polygon_into_classes` (Digital Inclusion)

**Input File:** `fake_DIG_percent.shp`

**Error:** Plugin reports "Layer has no CRS" error

**CONFIRMED: This is NOT a data problem.** The shapefile has valid CRS information and loads correctly in QGIS with proper CRS (EPSG:32620). The error occurs only when the plugin attempts to load the layer from a file path.

**Root Cause:** This is a manifestation of Issue #1. The plugin's file path loading mechanism fails to read layer metadata, including CRS information. The layer file itself is valid; the plugin's loading code is broken.

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Layer loads successfully in QGIS with valid CRS
- ✅ .prj file exists and contains correct CRS definition
- ❌ Plugin reports "Layer has no CRS" when loading from file path
- ❌ Same file path loading issue affects all other workflows

**Recommendation:**
- **Fix Issue #1 first** - this will resolve the CRS loading problem
- The error message "Layer has no CRS" is misleading; it should say "Failed to load layer from file path"
- Add validation to check if layer was loaded successfully before checking CRS
- Provide better error messages that indicate file loading failures vs. actual data problems

### Issue #3: Environmental Hazards Processing Failure ❌ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Affected Workflow:** `use_environmental_hazards`

**Failed Indicators:** Fire, Cyclone (3 others skipped)

**Error:** `native:fillnodata` algorithm fails with temp file not found

**Note:** This is likely related to Issue #1 - the raster files may not be loading properly from file paths, causing subsequent processing steps to fail.

**Recommendation:**
- **Primary**: Fix Issue #1 first, as this will likely resolve environmental hazards failures
- Add error handling for QGIS processing algorithms
- Verify temp directory exists and is writable
- Add validation for input raster format/integrity before processing
- Consider alternative fill algorithm if native fails
- Log processing parameters and file paths for debugging

### Issue #4: Inconsistent Workflow Status Reporting ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

**Error:** Workflows report "Completed" but lack output files

**Recommendation:**
- Add post-execution validation to verify result files exist
- Don't mark workflow as "Completed" unless output is verified
- Return more granular status: "Completed", "CompletedWithWarnings", "Failed"

## Recommendations: Fix the Root Cause

### Fix file path loading mechanism
- Investigate `QgsVectorLayer` and `QgsRasterLayer` instantiation from file paths
- Review how the plugin constructs and uses file paths
- Check for encoding issues, path resolution, or context problems
- Add logging at file loading points to see what's actually happening
- **Impact**: Fixing this ONE bug will likely resolve 65% of failures

All other issues (CRS errors, processing failures, null outputs) are Errors of the same broken file path loading mechanism.


**Expected Outcome:** Fixing Issue #1 should increase test success rate.
