# OOKLA Test data


This data was sourced from the OOKLA project (https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data).

I used Q3 2025 parquet files from the S3 bucket as source for this test data.

I then subset the data using QGIS's random extract processing tool to create two small
representative parquet files that can be used for unit testing.
