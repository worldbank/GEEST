    "about": "The Geospatial Enabling Environments for Employment Spatial Tool, developed by the World Bank, supports the evaluation of locations based on its supportiveness for employment and entrepreneurship. It allows for a generic analysis of foundational infrastructure and mobility aspects but also supports the inclusion of women specific considerations that can act as barriers in their economic empowerment. By analyzing spatial factors across three dimensions (Contextual/ Accessibility and Place Characterization) GeoE3 is a stepping stone to identifying the critical employment investments required in cities and regions.",

    "changelog": "Version 2.0.0 - Major Performance & Stability Release\\n\\n## Branding\\n* Complete WEE to GeoE3 rename across codebase (variables, dictionary keys, folder names, QML files, UI)\\n* User-visible text updated from 'WEE Score' to 'GeoE3 Score'\\n* Layer groups renamed from 'WEE' to 'GeoE3'\\n* BREAKING: Existing project files may need updates for new dictionary keys\\n\\n## Performance Improvements\\n* Optimized GeoPackage writes with GDAL settings (OGR_SQLITE_JOURNAL=MEMORY, OGR_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS=OFF)\\n* SQL-based batch updates replace feature-by-feature updates for dramatic speed improvements\\n* Parallel grid chunk processing with configurable worker count (grid_creation_workers setting)\\n* Memory-bounded parallel grid creation to prevent memory blowouts on large datasets\\n* Bounded write queue (100K max) with async writer thread for memory-efficient batch writes\\n* Two-phase spatial check (Contains then Intersects) reduces intersection tests by ~90%\\n* Segment-based spatial index queries for long linestrings reduce false positives\\n* Skip grid cells that already have max score to reduce unnecessary processing\\n* Skip study_area_grid layer in report generation (too many features to render)\\n* Optimized OSM polygon processing and greenspaces download\\n* Optimized native network analysis with feature matching improvements\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n* Fixed 2.5D geometry warnings - all geometries now properly flattened to 2D\\n* Fixed EPSG:54009 CRS warning - now uses correct ESRI:54009 for Mollweide projection\\n* Fixed mask layer creation with geometry validation and commitChanges\\n* Reverted multi_buffer_distances_native_workflow to stable v1.2.6\\n* Fixed raster layer validation in _subset_raster_layer with clear error messages\\n* Fixed crash when concurrency is greater than 1\\n* Fixed CRS handling in MultiBufferDistancesNativeWorkflow\\n* Fixed road network CRS issues\\n* Fixed AttributeError in RoadNetworkPanel by reordering attribute initialization\\n* Fixed multipart geometry handling in network analysis\\n* Fixed road network and data persistence checks\\n* Fixed study area creation for multipart geometries\\n* Fixed duplicate QMessageBox on OSM download error\\n* Fixed memory blowout in parallel grid creation\\n* Fixed banner text rendering and button styling\\n\\n## New Features\\n* GHSL download fallback - workflows automatically download GHSL data if missing\\n* ensure_ghsl_data() method for workflows that need settlement data\\n* Raster layer validation with helpful error messages before processing\\n* Progress bar updates during batch operations showing processing progress\\n* Status label showing current workflow step\\n* Dimension and factor map pages in analysis summary report\\n* Exclude unused indicators from analysis summary report\\n* GHSL download failure warning during project creation with user prompt\\n\\n## UI Improvements\\n* Improved banner text rendering and refined button styling\\n* Updated font sizing for women's considerations section\\n* Open existing project no longer shows women's options incorrectly\\n* Move EPLEX Score to contextual only\\n* Auto-balance weights under dimension\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n* All docstrings converted to Google-style format\\n* GitHub CI black version pinned to 25.x to match local development environment\\n* Comprehensive error handling and logging improvements\\n* Qt threading migration replacing Python threading\\n\\n## Previous 1.3.0 Changes\\n* OSM download: Added spinner animation and improved error feedback\\n* Reintegrated ORS v0.6 as routing option\\n* Education factor now uses index score with GHSL\\n* Fixed workflows stopping after 1 factor under dimension\\n* Added local caching for Ookla parquet files\\n* UI improvements: Dynamic font sizing, GeoE3 branding updates",
