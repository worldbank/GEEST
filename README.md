# Welcome to GEEST

<p align="justify">
 Developed by the World Bank, <strong>GEEST (The Gender Enabling Environments Spatial Tool)</strong> is a powerful and user-friendly open-source spatial mapping tool that enables a comprehensive analysis of how various spatial factors influence women's employment and business opportunities in any geographic area of interest. 
 
 By using this tool, you can identify key areas for intervention, make data-driven decisions, and ultimately work toward creating more equitable job opportunities for women across different regions.
