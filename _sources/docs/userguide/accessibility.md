## Accessibility
Test
<p align="justify"> 
The Accessibility Dimension evaluates women‚Äôs daily mobility by examining their access to essential services. Levels of enablement for work access in this dimension are determined by service areas, which represent the geographic zones that facilities like childcare, supermarkets, universities, banks, and clinics can serve based on proximity. The nearer these facilities are to where women live, the more supportive and enabling the environment becomes for their participation in the workforce. For more information on data input used from open sources, please refer to the <a href="https://worldbank.github.io/GEEST/docs/userguide/datacollection.html" target="_blank">Data Collection section</a>.
</p>

### General Overview
---
This tool evaluates how easily women can access essential services and amenities, considering their caregiving roles and daily travel needs. It uses geospatial area analysis with Openrouteservices (ORS) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to measure accessibility for several factors, including:

- **Women‚Äôs Travel Patterns:** Access to everyday services like pharmacies, markets, supermarkets, childcare centers, schools and parks.
- **Access to Public Transport:** Proximity to bus stops, train stations and other transport facilities.
- **Health Facilities:** Availability of clinics, hospitals and other healthcare services.
- **Education and Training Facilities:** Distance to colleges, universities and other training centers.
- **Financial Facilities:** Access to banks and financial support institutions.

**Travel mode**: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode, and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature.

**Measurement**: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters, which is most appropriate for walking. These <a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">thresholds<sup>1</sup></a> are based on evidence from the literature at the factor level and are designed to provide consistency across analyses. If driving is selected as a travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement.

---

üí° **Tip**: If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these increments. If the selected travel mode is driving, the equivalent measurement increments should be in minutes and informed by the local context (for example, if evidence suggests the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increments could be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30).

---

**Output**: The process generates zones around these amenities, showing how far women can travel on foot or by car within increasing distances or times. Each zone is assigned a score from 5 (high accessibility) to 0 (no accessibility), reflecting decreasing accessibility as distance or travel time increases.

#### Women‚Äôs Travel Patterns (WTP)
<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Women‚Äôs Travel Patterns (WTP)</strong> refer to the unique travel behaviors of women, often involving multiple stops for household or caregiving tasks, making proximity to essential services like markets, supermarkets, childcare centers, primary schools, pharmacies and green spaces crucial. This factor is composed by 5 subfactors which provide additional granularity: kindergartens/childcare | primary schools | groceries | pharmacies | green spaces.

### Process Accessibility factors
---
After configuring the factors and adjusting their weights to achieve balance, you can initiate the process workflow:

> - üñ±Ô∏è**Right-click on Accessibility**.  
> - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Select Run Item Workflow** from the context menu.

<p align="center">

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worldbank/GEEST/main/docs/images/new%20images/ACC%20run.jpg" 
    alt="Accessibility Run" 
    style="width:75%;" 
    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

The process should be successfully completed and indicated by a green checkmark widget.

### Visualizing the Outputs 
---
After completing the process, the outputs are automatically added to the Layer Panel in QGIS as a group layer. This group layer has the *Mutually Exclusive Group* feature activated, which ensures that only one layer within the group can be visible at a time. When this feature is enabled, turning on the visibility of one layer automatically turns off the visibility of the others within the same group, making it easier to compare results without overlapping visualizations.

The outputs consist of all factors and subfactors, as well as the aggregation of these into the final Accessibility output. All scores are assessed on a scale from 0 to 5, categorized as follows: ‚â§ 0.5 (Not Enabling) | 0.5‚Äì1.5 (Very Low Enablement) | 1.5‚Äì2.5 (Low Enablement) | 2.5‚Äì3.5 (Moderately Enabling) | 3.5‚Äì4.5 (Enabling) | 4.5‚Äì5.0 (Highly Enabling).

<span style="color: red;">[Not working - Need to be amended]</span>

The outputs are stored under the Accessibility folder within the project folder created during the setup phase as raster files. These files can be shared and further utilized for various purposes, such as visualization in QGIS or other GIS software, integration into reports, overlaying with other spatial datasets, or performing advanced geospatial analyses, such as identifying priority areas or conducting trend analysis based on the scores.

If the results do not immediately appear in the Layer Panel after processing the Accessibility Dimension, you can resolve this by either adding them manually from the folder path or by right-clicking on the Accessibility Dimension and selecting **Add to map** from the context menu:

<p align="center">

    style="width:75%;" 
    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

> üí° **Tip**: If the input needs to be changed for any reason (e.g., incorrect initial input), you can clear the results and reprocess them as follows:
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click** on the factor/dimension and select **Clear Item**.  
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click again** on the same cleared factor/dimension, and while holding the **SHIFT** key on your keyboard, select **Run Item Workflow**.
> This process ensures that the tool reassesses the input datasets and outputs the corrected scores.

### Key Considerations
---
- **Input Accuracy**: Ensure all input datasets are carefully entered/selected and correspond to the correct factors and/or subfactors. Incorrect data will impact the outputs and subsequent analysis.

- **Weight Adjustment**: Assign weights thoughtfully to reflect the importance of each factor in the overall analysis. After making changes, always balance the weights to ensure they sum up correctly.
