## Contextual

<p align="justify"> 
The Contextual Dimension refers to the laws and policies that shape workplace gender discrimination, financial autonomy, and overall gender empowerment. Although this dimension may vary between countries due to differences in legal frameworks, it remains consistent within a single country, as national policies and regulations are typically applied uniformly across countries.

<p align="justify"> 
Workplace Discrimination involves laws that address gender biases and stereotypes that hinder women's career advancement, especially in male-dominated fields.
This indicator is composed by the Workplace Index score of the WBL 2024, which is then standardized on a scale from 0 to 5.

<h3>Step 1: Weights Set-Up</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Locate the Contextual Dimension Section:</strong>
        <ul>
               <span>🔍 Right-Click on Contextual Dimension.</span><br>
               <span>⚙️ Select Edit Attributes.</span>
        </ul>
        <img src="your_image_path_here" alt="IMAGE for Weights" style="width:100%;"/>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Opening the Edit Attributes Dialog</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ensure the <em>Weights</em> values are filled in:</strong>
        <ul>
            <span>  🖊️ Ensure that all Weight fields are filled with valid numerical entries.</span><br>
            <span>  ✔️ Press <strong>OK</strong> to confirm your input.</span><br>
            <p>
</ul>
        
<p align="justify"> 
    <span style="color: orange; font-size: 50px;">⚠️</span>
    <strong>If equal weights are not suitable for the specific context of the analysis, the user can adjust the weights as necessary, ensuring that all weights still sum to 100!</strong> The default weights are <strong>34%</strong> for <strong>Workplace Discrimination</strong>, <strong>33%</strong> for <strong>Regulatory Frameworks</strong>, and <strong>33%</strong> for <strong>Financial Inclusion</strong>. If a factor was not calculated—perhaps due to missing data or because it was deemed unimportant—that factor should be assigned a weight of <strong>0%</strong>. Subsequently, the remaining factor weights must be adjusted to ensure they collectively add up to <strong>100%</strong>.
