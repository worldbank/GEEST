## Place Characterization

<p align="justify"> 
The Place Characterization Dimension refers to the social, environmental, and infrastructural attributes of geographical locations, such as walkability, safety, and vulnerability to natural hazards. Unlike the Accessibility Dimension, these factors do not involve mobility but focus on the inherent characteristics of a place that influence women‚Äôs ability to participate in the workforce. For more information on data input used from open sources, please refer to the <a href="https://worldbank.github.io/GEEST/docs/userguide/datacollection.html" target="_blank">Data Collection section</a>.
</p>

### General Overview

Place Characterization factors refer to the following indicators:

- **Active Transport:** identifies areas based on their ability to support safe and efficient active transport for women, such as walking, cycling, and other non-motorized modes of travel, by analyzing features like street crossings, block lengths, footpaths, and cycle paths.
- **Safety:** defines areas perceived as safe based on specific data or, alternatively, on how brightly lit they are, assuming that brightly lit areas are safer than those with no lights.
- **Fragility, conflict and violence (FCV):** assigns scores to by analyzing overlap with ACLED data with buffers representing various types of events.
- **Education:** computes a raster containing a standardized measure of the percentage of women who have attained higher education in the country/region of interest.
- **Digital Inclusion:** assesses the availability and accessibility of digital infrastructure.
- **Environmental Hazards:** characterizes areas based on their vulnerability to natural disasters.
- **Water sanitation:** assesses the availability and accessibility of clean water and sanitation facilities.

The default <a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">thresholds<sup>1</sup></a> are listed in the footnote:

#### Environmental Hazards

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Environmental Hazards</strong> relate to the impact of environmental risks, such as floods, droughts, landslides, fires and extreme weather events, which can disrupt job stability, particularly for women in vulnerable sectors.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This factor is composed, by default, of five subfactors representing different types of hazards: fires, floods, landslides, tropical cyclones and droughts. These subfactors are aggregated into a single factor, referred to as Environmental Hazards, based on the selected weights assigned to each subfactor.

If data for one or more hazard types is not available, these subfactors can be excluded from the processing. In such cases, the tool will automatically adjust the weights of the remaining subfactors to ensure accurate aggregation.

The thresholds for defining hazard levels are based on a predefined list <span style="color: red;">(**provided in the footnote**)</span>. The processing relies on globally available open data sources integrated into the tool. However, if more precise and localized data is available, users are encouraged to incorporate it into the processing. In doing so, users should align the data with the thresholds provided to maintain consistency and reliability.

After configuring the factors and adjusting their weights to achieve balance, you can initiate the process workflow:

> - üñ±Ô∏è**Right-click on Place Characterization**.  
> - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Select Run Item Workflow** from the context menu.

<p align="center">

    alt="Place Characterization Run" 
    style="width:75%;" 
    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

The process should be successfully completed and indicated by a green checkmark widget.

### Visualizing the Outputs 
---
After completing the process, the outputs are automatically added to the Layer Panel in QGIS as a group layer. This group layer has the *Mutually Exclusive Group* feature activated, which ensures that only one layer within the group can be visible at a time. When this feature is enabled, turning on the visibility of one layer automatically turns off the visibility of the others within the same group, making it easier to compare results without overlapping visualizations.

The outputs consist of all factors and subfactors, as well as the aggregation of these into the final Place Characterization output. All scores are assessed on a scale from 0 to 5, categorized as follows: ‚â§ 0.5 (Not Enabling) | 0.5‚Äì1.5 (Very Low Enablement) | 1.5‚Äì2.5 (Low Enablement) | 2.5‚Äì3.5 (Moderately Enabling) | 3.5‚Äì4.5 (Enabling) | 4.5‚Äì5.0 (Highly Enabling).

<span style="color: red;">[Not working - Need to be amended]</span>

The outputs are stored under the Place Characterization folder within the project folder created during the setup phase as raster files. These files can be shared and further utilized for various purposes, such as visualization in QGIS or other GIS software, integration into reports, overlaying with other spatial datasets, or performing advanced geospatial analyses, such as identifying priority areas or conducting trend analysis based on the scores.

If the results do not immediately appear in the Layer Panel after processing the Place Characterization Dimension, you can resolve this by either adding them manually from the folder path or by right-clicking on the Place Characterization Dimension and selecting **Add to map** from the context menu:

<p align="center">

    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

> üí° **Tip**: If the input needs to be changed for any reason (e.g., incorrect initial input), you can clear the results and reprocess them as follows:
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click** on the factor/dimension and select **Clear Item**.  
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click again** on the same cleared factor/dimension, and while holding the **SHIFT** key on your keyboard, select **Run Item Workflow**.
> This process ensures that the tool reassesses the input datasets and outputs the corrected scores.

### Key Considerations
---
- **Input Accuracy**: Ensure all input datasets are carefully entered/selected and correspond to the correct factors and/or subfactors. Incorrect data will impact the outputs and subsequent analysis.

- **Weight Adjustment**: Assign weights thoughtfully to reflect the importance of each factor in the overall analysis. After making changes, always balance the weights to ensure they sum up correctly.
  
<small>
    <a id="footnote1" href="#ref1">1</a>: <span style="color: #505050;"><strong>Active transport</strong></span> factor is calculated based on four factors averaged across the raster cells:
    <br>
    <strong>Street Crossings scores</strong>: (score 0 = none, score 3 = 1 crossing, score 5 = 2+ crossings)<br>
    <strong>Cycle Paths scores</strong>: (score 0 = none, score 3 = 1 cycle path, score 5 = 2+ paths)<br>
    <strong>Footpaths scores</strong>: (score 0 = none, score 3 = 1 path, score 5 = 2+ paths)<br>
    <strong>Block Sizes scores</strong>: (score 0 = none, score 1 = >1 km, score 2 = 751m-1 km, score 3 = 501m-750m, score 4 = 251m-500m, score 5 = <250m)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Safety</strong> is calculated by generating 20-meter buffers around streetlights. Raster cells where 80-100% of their area intersects with these buffers are assigned a <em>score of 5</em>. Cells with 60-79% intersection receive a <em>score of 4</em>, 40-59% a <em>score of 3</em>, 20-39% a <em>score of 2</em>, and 1-19% a <em>score of 1</em>. Cells with no overlap are <em>scored as 0</em>. <strong>Note:</strong> Use nighttime light data only if streetlight data is unavailable.
    <br><br>
    <strong>FCV</strong> is structured by assigning scores to raster cells based on their overlap with buffers representing different types of events. Using point locations of FCV (Fragility, Conflict, and Violence) events, create circular buffers with a radius of 5 km to estimate the spatial impact. If a specific event's impact radius is known, it should be applied instead. Raster cells intersecting with these buffers are scored as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Rasters overlapping with buffers for battles and explosions: <em>score 0</em></li>
        <li>Rasters overlapping with buffers for explosions and remote violence: <em>score 1</em></li>
        <li>Rasters overlapping with buffers for violence against civilians: <em>score 2</em></li>

    <strong>Water Sanitation</strong> is assessed based on the presence of water and sanitation facilities within a raster cell, applying a default 1000m buffer. The scoring is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Raster cell with no water points: <em>score 0</em></li>
        <li>Raster cell with 1 water point: <em>score 3</em></li>
        <li>Raster cell with 2 or more water points: <em>score 5</em></li>
    </ul>
