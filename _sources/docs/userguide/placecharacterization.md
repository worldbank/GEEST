## Place Characterization

<p align="justify"> 
The Place Characterization Dimension refers to the social, environmental, and infrastructural attributes of geographical locations, such as walkability, safety, and vulnerability to natural hazards. Unlike the Accessibility Dimension, these factors do not involve mobility but focus on the inherent characteristics of a place that influence women‚Äôs ability to participate in the workforce. For more information on data input used from open sources, please refer to the <a href="https://worldbank.github.io/GEEST/docs/userguide/datacollection.html" target="_blank">Data Collection section</a>.
</p>

### General Overview

Place Characterization factors refer to the following indicators:

- **Active Transport:** identifies areas based on their ability to support safe and efficient active transport for women, such as walking, cycling, and other non-motorized modes of travel, by analyzing features like street crossings, block lengths, footpaths, and cycle paths.
- **Safety:** defines areas perceived as safe based on specific data or, alternatively, on how brightly lit they are, assuming that brightly lit areas are safer than those with no lights.
- **Fragility, conflict and violence (FCV):** assigns scores to by analyzing overlap with ACLED data with buffers representing various types of events.
- **Education:** computes a raster containing a standardized measure of the percentage of women who have attained higher education in the country/region of interest.
- **Digital Inclusion:** assesses the availability and accessibility of digital infrastructure.
- **Environmental Hazards:** characterizes areas based on their vulnerability to natural disasters.
- **Water sanitation:** assesses the availability and accessibility of clean water and sanitation facilities.

For certain factors, **multiple data input options** are available depending on the data's format and availability.

### Input Place Characterization factors
---
#### Active Transport

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Active Transport</strong> refers to the presence of walkable environments and cycling infrastructure, as women often rely on walking or cycling for their daily commutes and errands. This factor is composed by 4 subfactors which provide additional granularity: street crossings | cycly paths | footpaths | block layout.

**Locate Active Transport Section**

> - üñ±Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è **Double-click** on the **Active Transport section** to open the pop-up.
> - üìù In the *Input* field, you can select layers already loaded in the QGIS Layer Panel from the dropdown menu or manually enter the file path for the shapefiles (**point features for street crossings, lines for cycle paths and footpaths and polygons for block layout**) corresponding to the indicators by clicking the three-dot button.
> - ‚öñÔ∏è **Assign Weights**: Assign appropriate weights to reflect the relative importance of each factor in the analysis. Ensure these values are consistent with your project objectives, accurately represent the significance of each factor and add up to 1 for a balanced evaluation.
> - üö´ **Exclude Unused Factors (optional)**: If a specific factor is not intended to be included in the process, uncheck the **Use** button associated with it.
> - üîÑ **Readjust Weights**: After excluding any factors, make sure to **Balance Weights** of the remaining factors. This step ensures the weight distribution remains balanced and totals correctly, preserving the integrity of the analysis.
> - ‚úÖ **Finalize**: Once all settings are configured, click OK to confirm and proceed to the next step.
