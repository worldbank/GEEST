## Place Characterization

<p align="justify"> 
The Place Characterization Dimension refers to the social, environmental, and infrastructural attributes of geographical locations, such as walkability, safety, and vulnerability to natural hazards. Unlike the Accessibility Dimension, these factors do not involve mobility but focus on the inherent characteristics of a place that influence women‚Äôs ability to participate in the workforce. For more information on data input used from open sources, please refer to the <a href="https://worldbank.github.io/GEEST/docs/userguide/datacollection.html" target="_blank">Data Collection section</a>.
</p>

### General Overview

Place Characterization factors refer to the following indicators:

- **Active Transport:** identifies areas based on their capacity to support safe and efficient active transport for women‚Äîsuch as walking, cycling, and other non-motorized modes‚Äîby analyzing and categorizing the road network features downloaded during the project setup phase.
- **Safety:** defines areas perceived as safe based on specific data or, alternatively, on how brightly lit they are, assuming that brightly lit areas are safer than those with no lights.
- **Fragility, conflict and violence (FCV):** assigns scores to by analyzing overlap with ACLED data with buffers representing various types of events.
- **Education:** computes a raster that provides a standardized measure of the percentage of women who have attained higher education within the country or region of interest, distributing this information across urbanized areas as defined by the GHS-SMOD classification.
- **Digital Inclusion:** assesses the availability and accessibility of digital infrastructure by computing a national index score based on the Ookla dataset for both mobile and fixed network coverage.
- **Environmental Hazards:** characterizes areas based on their vulnerability to natural disasters.
- **Water sanitation:** assesses the availability and accessibility of clean water and sanitation facilities.

For certain factors, **multiple data input options** are available depending on the data's format and availability.

As with the Accessibility dimension, **Active transport, Safety and Water sanitation** factors can be processed according to the level of analysis‚Äîwhether conducted at a broader scale, such as the **national level**, or tailored to a more localized context, such as **urban or regional** areas.

### Input Place Characterization factors

#### Active Transport

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Active Transport</strong> refers to the availability of walkable environments and cycling infrastructure, recognizing that women often rely on non-motorized modes of travel for daily commutes and errands. This factor is calculated by assigning scores to road network features, obtained during the project setup phase, as detailed below:

Depending on the level of analysis, the scoring approach varies:

- **At the national level**, each Point of Interest (POI) is enclosed within a 1 km¬≤ buffer. Raster grid cells that intersect this buffer receive a score of **5** (indicating access to street lighting). Cells that do **not** intersect any buffer receive a score of **0** (indicating no access).

- **At the local level**, a 20-meter buffer is computed around each POI. Raster cells are scored based on the percentage of their area that intersects with these buffers:

| Factor   | Score 0                | Score 1                 | Score 2                 | Score 3                 | Score 4                 | Score 5                 |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Safety** | No overlap            | 1-19% intersection      | 20-39% intersection     | 40-59% intersection     | 60-79% intersection     | 80-100% intersection    |

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>FCV</strong> is structured by assigning scores to raster cells based on their overlap with buffers representing different types of conflict-related events. Using geolocated point data of FCV incidents, circular buffers are generated to reflect the typical spatial influence of each event type. Each event type is assigned a <strong>default buffer distance</strong>‚Äîfor example, <strong>5 km</strong> for battles and explosions, <strong>2 km</strong> for violence against civilians, and <strong>1‚Äì2 km</strong> for protests and riots. These buffers are used to assess the extent to which each event type may affect surrounding areas. Raster cells that intersect one or more event buffers are assigned scores based on the <strong>severity</strong> of the event type, as outlined in the table below:
</p>

| **Event Type**                   | **Default Buffer Distance**       | **Score** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| Battles and explosions           | 5 km                              | 0         |
| Explosions and remote violence   | 5 km                              | 1         |
| Violence against civilians       | 2 km                              | 2         |
| Protests and riots               | 1 km for protests, 2 km for riots | 4         |
| No intersecting events           | NA                                | 5         |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** It is common for a single location to register multiple FCV events over time.  
> In such cases, a **priority-based scoring approach** is applied: the raster cell receives the score of the **most severe** event type within its extent.  
>  
> *Example:* If an area experienced 4 protests, 2 riots, and 1 battle in the same year, the final score assigned would be **0**, reflecting the highest severity (battle or explosion).

#### Environmental Hazards

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Environmental Hazards</strong> relate to the impact of environmental risks, such as floods, droughts, landslides, fires and extreme weather events, which can disrupt job stability, particularly for women in vulnerable sectors.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This factor is composed, by default, of five subfactors representing different types of hazards: fires, floods, landslides, tropical cyclones and droughts. These subfactors are aggregated into a single factor, referred to as Environmental Hazards, based on the selected weights assigned to each subfactor.

If data for one or more hazard types is not available, these subfactors can be excluded from the processing. In such cases, the tool will automatically adjust the weights of the remaining subfactors to ensure accurate aggregation.

The thresholds for defining hazard levels are based on a predefined scoring list. The input data relies on globally available open data sources and is reclassified for use within the tool. However, if more precise and localized data is available, users are encouraged to incorporate it into the processing. In doing so, users should align the data with the thresholds provided to maintain consistency and reliability.

### Process Place Characterization factors
---
After configuring the factors and adjusting their weights to achieve balance, you can initiate the process workflow:

> - üñ±Ô∏è**Right-click on Place Characterization**.  
> - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Select Run Item Workflow** from the context menu.

<p align="center">

    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

The process should be successfully completed and indicated by a green checkmark widget.

### Visualizing the Outputs 
---
After completing the process, the outputs are automatically added to the Layer Panel in QGIS as a group layer. This group layer has the *Mutually Exclusive Group* feature activated, which ensures that only one layer within the group can be visible at a time. When this feature is enabled, turning on the visibility of one layer automatically turns off the visibility of the others within the same group, making it easier to compare results without overlapping visualizations.

The outputs consist of all factors and subfactors, as well as the aggregation of these into the final Place Characterization output. All scores are assessed on a scale from 0 to 5, categorized as follows: ‚â§ 0.5 (Not Enabling) | 0.5‚Äì1.5 (Very Low Enablement) | 1.5‚Äì2.5 (Low Enablement) | 2.5‚Äì3.5 (Moderately Enabling) | 3.5‚Äì4.5 (Enabling) | 4.5‚Äì5.0 (Highly Enabling).

The outputs are stored under the Place Characterization folder within the project folder created during the setup phase as raster files. These files can be shared and further utilized for various purposes, such as visualization in QGIS or other GIS software, integration into reports, overlaying with other spatial datasets, or performing advanced geospatial analyses, such as identifying priority areas or conducting trend analysis based on the scores.

If the results do not immediately appear in the Layer Panel after processing the Place Characterization Dimension, you can resolve this by either adding them manually from the folder path or by right-clicking on the Place Characterization Dimension and selecting **Add to map** from the context menu:

<p align="center">

    style="width:75%;" 
    title="Click to enlarge" 
    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

> üí° **Tip**: If the input needs to be changed for any reason (e.g., incorrect initial input), you can clear the results and reprocess them as follows:
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click** on the factor/dimension and select **Clear Item**.  
> - üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click again** on the same cleared factor/dimension, and while holding the **SHIFT** key on your keyboard, select **Run Item Workflow**.
> This process ensures that the tool reassesses the input datasets and outputs the corrected scores.

    onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank')">
</p>

### Key Considerations
---
- **Input Accuracy**: Ensure all input datasets are carefully entered/selected and correspond to the correct factors and/or subfactors. Incorrect data will impact the outputs and subsequent analysis.

- **Weight Adjustment**: Assign weights thoughtfully to reflect the importance of each factor in the overall analysis. After making changes, always balance the weights to ensure they sum up correctly.
