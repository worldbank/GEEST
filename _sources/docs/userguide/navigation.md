---

#### **Step 1: Get Your API Key**
1. Open your browser and go to the [ORS API Key Signup Page](https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/).
2. Register for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Once logged in, generate an API key by following the on-screen instructions.

#### **Step 2: Paste the API Key**
1. Copy the API key from the ORS website.
2. Open the **GEEST ORS Setup** window in the plugin.
3. Paste the API key into the text box provided (as shown in the screenshot below).
