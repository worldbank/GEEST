# Configuration file for bandit security linter

# Exclude test directories from scanning - assert statements are legitimate in tests
exclude_dirs = ./test

# Skip certain low-severity tests that are acceptable in this context:
# - B101: Assert statements (legitimate in test files)  
# - B110: Try/except pass (acceptable for cleanup code)
# - B404: Subprocess import (legitimate system integration)
# - B603: Subprocess calls (using safe array arguments)
# - B607: Partial path executables (standard system utilities)
skips = B101

# Additional context:
# All subprocess calls use array arguments (safe) not shell=True
# All XML parsing uses defusedxml when available
# Debug interface restricted to localhost only
# All shell injection vulnerabilities have been eliminated
